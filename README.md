# adventure.js
A simple text-based adventure game engine written in JavaScript

This project was originally to be handled by my teacher, but he decided to give this task to me instead.
The scope of the project was a custom text-based game engine, where the students would design the rooms and enemies that the player would encounter.

The basics of the engine were laid out by my teacher when he gave it to me, at which point I felt compelled to add more features so that it would provide a richer experience that was in keeping with my expectations of a typical game of its nature.

This engine features items, an inventory, chests, enemies and combat, player and enemy status, and more.

This repository contains the game engine as well as three rooms, four items and one enemy.
The engine, however, allows for as many combinations and/or additions of the above as desired.
