adventure.js : A simple text-based adventure game engine written in JavaScript

This project was originally to be handled by my Uni teacher Tim, but he decided to give this task to me instead.
In its entire scope, the purpose of the exercise was to have Tim write the engine and for the students in his class to design the rooms.

The basics of the engine were laid out by Tim when he gave it to me.
When the engine was handed over to me, I found that it was quite bare and needed more features before it could be considered a "proper" game.

My additions to the engine were items, an inventory, chests, enemies and combat code,
player and enemy status, and various other features to complete this project to a much higher standard.

This repository contains the game engine as well as three rooms, four items and one enemy.
The engine, however, allows for as many combinations and/or additions of the above as desired.

I submitted this project as my assignment instead of another simpler exercise.
The purpose of the assignment was to demonstrate an understanding of the basic programming techniques and the JavaScript language.
Tim said that in completing this project, I exceeded the requirements of this assignment.
